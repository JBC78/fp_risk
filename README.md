# Risk Classification & Authority To Work Health Status
On any given day, there are over 400 contractor employees working on my job site, performing varying tasks such as welding, high voltage electrical work, civil, facility cleaning, High Pressure blasting to name a few. Each of these tasks require an Authority To Work authorisation prior to starting work and are risk classified appropriately based on the exposure to the business and the workers. For every job, a company representative is required to visit the job site with the contractor representative to ensure that there are no new hazards and the area is safe to start work using the existing approved controls.
The company representatives have identified that they are time poor with managing their own work crews let alone contractors and subsequently do not complete all tasks required of them with regards to both crew management (coaching, job checks, people management etc.) and Authority To Work requirements (field verifications, job front sign off).
In light of this concern, I employed a worker to come onsite and complete a Health Status audit on the Authority To Work process, where a contact was made with 386 work fronts to collect specific data based on the job and the Authority To Work form.
# Machine Learning NLP - sckikit-learn Naive Bayes Classifier
From the information gathered, we were able to develop a user defined risk classification tool which predicted whether the work to be performed was going to be either High Risk, Medium Risk or Low Risk.
# Visualisation Findings
(1) The data collated indicates that the Authority To Work process is unhealthy and operating at 57.70% compliance.<br>
(2) The company representative is time poor and not able to visit all jobs in a timely manner, either delaying a 
job start or not visiting the job at all. Delayed job starts caused by the company impact the companys budget on the bottom line.<br>
(3) Contracting Company GLU perform the most High risk work onsite across there three disciplines of Mechanical, 
Rope Acess & Scaffolding.<br>
(4) Work performed between the hours of 0800 and 1400 have a 54% chance of not having a Job Front Review completed by the Company Representative. This allows potential unknown hazards or conditions to creep in to the work place unbeknown to the contract workers.
# Findings Proposal
(1) Review the intent and framework of the Authority To Proceed procedure. <br>
(2) Perform financial impact analysis to the business caused by delayed job starts due to the availability of the company representative.<br>
(3) Leverage financial impact analysis to employ dedicated company representatives to coordinate contractor works at an oOperating Centre level.
